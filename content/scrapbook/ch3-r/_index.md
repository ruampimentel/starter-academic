Probably most of this part of the scrapbook is someplace in the [Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/). This book is amazing, full of all sorts of resources you might need to work with R. 

But I'm (re)organizing here on my own way anyway. Mainly the ones that I most use and most need.

# Books

[R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/). As you may imagine, to create your own package. Not as hard as it seems :D.

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). First way to go book for organizing datasets and wrangling data.
