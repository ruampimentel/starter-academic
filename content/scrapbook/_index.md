Welcome to my Statistics Scrapbook, here I'm collecting all new things that I learn, or that I consider I might need more information in the future.

So far, nothing here is original product of mine, I either read someplace else, or someone taught me that. I will always put reference to the original source. 

This is a book for my learning, I'm posting here because it might be helpful for someone else as well.
