If trying to format unpublished work according to APA guidelines, the best way to do it on Zotero is putting the following setting:

For `Item Type`, select `Thesis`.

For `Type`, describe the kinf of unpublished work, e.g., `Unpublished doctoral dissertation`, `Unpublished Thesis`, `Unpublished scoring manual`, `Manuscript tubmitted for publication` and so on (no need to put square-brakets, Zotero will do it automatically).

For `University`, put the entire description for deparment and university (or place). E.g., `Deparment of Psychology, University of Toledo`

Zotero will create a reference like that:

  Pimentel, R. P. F. A., Meyer, G. J., & Mihura, J. L. (2022). *Malingering severe psychopathology on the Rorschach task: Systematic review and meta-analysis* [Manuscript in preparation]. Department of Psychology, University of Toledo.


  Meyer, G. J., Pimentel, R. P. F. A., Pianowski, G., & Vanhoyland, M. (2021). *Coding criteria for Breaking the Card Boundary (BCB)* [Unpublished scoring manual]. Department of Psychology, University of Toledo.
