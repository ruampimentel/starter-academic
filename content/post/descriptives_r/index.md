Here are the functions I often use to describe and summarize my data.
 
PS: After putting this together, I decided to google about it to see what other's have been using, and found another post explaining the same functions [in Adam's post](https://dabblingwithdata.wordpress.com/2018/01/02/my-favourite-r-package-for-summarising-data/). So if you want to learn how to use them, I would recommend you to check [Adam's post](https://dabblingwithdata.wordpress.com/2018/01/02/my-favourite-r-package-for-summarising-data/). 

I have here as easy access for myself. As I find more functions, I will keep updating this post.

I'm using as data example the `mtcars` dataset that is built-in in R. And also, using my best friend pipe (`%>%`)

```R
library(dplyr)

mtcars %>% summary()
mtcars %>% skimr::skim() 
mtcars %>% Hmisc::describe()
mtcars %>% psych::describe()
mtcars %>% pastecs::stat.desc(norm = T) %>% t() %>% round(2) 
mtcars %>% summarytools::dfSummary() %>% summarytools::view()
mtcars %>% summarytools::descr(transpose = T)
```

Now, I will put
