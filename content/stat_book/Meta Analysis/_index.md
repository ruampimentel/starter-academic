## Resources

[Doing Meta-Analysis with R: A Hand-on Guide](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/). The title is self-explanatory. Amazing book, my "go-to" book for. {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}}

[Meta-Analysis Learning Information Center](https://www.meta-analysis-learning-information-center.com/) [^1] They have video guides and lecture guides. It is a must check it out. Their [video guides](https://www.meta-analysis-learning-information-center.com/video-guides-1) section teach about how to do stuff using R. 

[^1]: I learn about this website from Dr. Mihura.
